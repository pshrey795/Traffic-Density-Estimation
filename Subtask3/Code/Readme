The contents of this folder have been prepared by Shrey Patel(2019CS10400) and Rahul Chhabra(2019CS11016)

This folder named "Code" contains two sub-folders:

1)C++ codes using OpenCV
	a)video.cpp     -> Original code from subtask-2 (but without dynamic density calculation)
	b)video_m1.cpp  -> Sub-sampling of frames
	c)video_m2.cpp  -> Changing Resolution 
	d)video_m3.cpp  -> Spatial Threading
	e)video_m4.cpp  -> Temporal Threading

2) The Makefile which is used to create all executables. 
	
--How to compile?
Type "make all" in command line to build the executables "video","video1","video2","video3" and "video4"

--How to run the executables?
To execute "video" file, type "./video" in the command line followed by the video you want to input. 
For e.g. "./video trafficvideo.mp4" and similar for other executables. After running the executable
the program will ask for the required parameter(s) according to the method used which have to be provided
in the console itself.

--Notes
1) The build files can be cleaned from the directory by typing "make clean" in command line.

2) Double quotes in this document are not to be literally typed in command line, they have been used 
to separate actual commands from plain text.

3) Any failure to follow the above steps for compilation/running/providing input will be accompanied by 
an error message which will instruct/suggest the correct procedure.
